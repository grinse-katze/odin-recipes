            <li>1 1/2 cups sliced almonds</li>
            <li>Two pinches of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all of the cake ingredients in a  bowl, stirring till it combined and battery, then stirring for two minutes more.</li>
            <li>Get all the batter off of the sides of the bowl and then cover with plastic wrap to let rise for an hour.</li>
            <li>For the crunchy toppings: In medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter, sugar, honey, cream and salt until the butter is melted. Bring to a simmer and let it boil for 3 to 5 minutes, until the mixture gets a bit darker. Set it aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Butter and flour a 8-inch round cake pan.Deflate the batter and then nudge it until it fills the bottom of the pan. Cover again with plastic wrap  and set aside for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat your oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>To make the pastry filling, warm milk in a medium saucepan. Slowly drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of honey into the milk and warm it. Pour into a small bowl or cup, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse saucepan and off the heat, whisk the yolks and sugar together like an angry viking. Whisk in flour and salt. Drizzle in warm honey-milk a spoonful at a time, whisking indefinitely. Off the heat, whisk in the butter and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Once the cake has finished its second rise, you gotta put the almond crunchy stuff on the cake.</li>
            <li>Bake cake for 20 to 25 minutes, until top is bronzed and toothpick inserted into the center comes out batter-free.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a cooling rack and after it sits a bit, run a knife around the circumference to free it from its spring form clutches. Let it cool.</li>  
            <li>Finally, assemble the cake by flipping it and dividing it in half, width-wise, with a serrated knife. Do this carefully.</li>
            <li>Once both the cake and pastry cream are fully cooled, place the cake on a serving platter and enjoy!</li>
